## Can we trust this science? {background-color="black"}

<!-- For github deployment, followed these instructions for github pages https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html -->

<!-- When I wrote this book one of the things I noticed was that to explain MOT and its role in the mind one mainly ended up explaining things about the mind that we know from other paradigms.

Not every field of psychology is like that.
This is not a unified theory of tracking. That would be a different talk. This is broad empirical generalizations, the ingredients to a unified theory.

## The replication crisis

::: nonincremental

-   Replication projects show re-running a study [often yields a different result](https://alexholcombe.wordpress.com/2023/08/08/an-executive-summary-of-sciences-replication-crisis/(opens in a new tab))
-   One cause is [p-hacking](https://shinyapps.org/apps/p-hacker/)

## Assessing a scientific literature without re-doing the studies

- Very hard
- One proxy for whether a literature gets vetted is whether it's transparent ([Vazire & Holcombe, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1177/10892680211033912)

## Follows best practices? Has obvious errors?

- Guidelines
  - Clinical trials has heaps
  - Other areas, not as much
- Sample size planning
- Statcheck

## Justine's honours project

::: nonincremental
- Motivation
- Topic
- Process
- Google Sheet

## Groups

::: nonincremental
-   Exchange contact details.
-   Set up a virtual workspace to exchange messages and documents, like Slack or a Facebook group
-   Set up meetings

::: notes
In writing this little book, I distilled the results of hundreds of studies to a short list of empirical generalizations. Broad lessons for how cognition and perception connect, it turns out.

In some ways, visual attention and memory are a coherent scientific field. I mean that findings from paradigms other than MOT generalize to MOT too.

## Homework

-   Do the readings
-   Choose a research article that interests you
    - For that article, try to fill out Justine's columns
      - Create a copy of Google Sheet
    - Write down notes and problems that you have

Exciting

## Project process

::: nonincremental
- Identify a research area of interest
- Identify/choose some proxies of research trustworthiness.
- Write a plan to measure those proxies.
- Pre-register the plan
- Divide up the plan and do it.
